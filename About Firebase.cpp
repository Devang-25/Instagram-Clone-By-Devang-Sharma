Material UI:
hey guys so for some of the things like
the Avatar the buttons that you know is
that's a really nice design library from
Google called material UI so we're gonna
use that


STEPS:

Link: firebase.google.com
- Add Project
- Configure Google Analytics
- Register the App with Hosting
- npm install firebase
- sudo npm install -g firebase-tools

Link: https://console.firebase.google.com/

doing that firebase is a set of tools
it's a suite of tools actually from
Google and it allows you to do a bunch
of different things so today we're
actually gonna use three of these
different services maybe four I think
that what we're doing is we're having
the database on firebase so it's gonna
be a complete back-end solution for that

you guys so you can have your database
hosted here authentication so all the
logging in and everything that you just
saw them that happens through firebase
and we can also deploy the website so it
can be live on an actual link that
everyone can access afterwards and we
also have firebase storage which is how
you were able to see the picture that
cause he uploaded actually go online and
then we can actually store that into our
database so there's a bunch of things
