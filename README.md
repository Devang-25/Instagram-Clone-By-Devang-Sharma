git commit -m "Added Instagram"</br>
git push</br>
</br>

### 🚀 Host on Heroku</br>

</br>

### 🚀 Web Site:

Front-End:</br>

Client Side:</br>


- What you See/Experience as a User ? 
(UI and UX)</br>

UI: User interface</br>
UX: User Experience</br>




Back-End:
- Server Side:

- Data and Logic
</br>

Logic: Code to Have EDA (Event Driven Architecture)
Eg: Click on Buy Now -> Payment Page
</br>

Data: Database
</br>

What? -> Collection of All Information
</br>

Why? -> To Query Over It and Fetch the Details



E-Commerce:
</br>

Search Bar -> "Black Jacket"
</br>

Results:
</br>

Jacket-1
</br>
Jacket-2
</br>
Jacket-3
</br>

All Items Stored: DB
</br>
Fetch "Jacket" -> Query the DB
</br>



### 🚀 FLOW:
</br>

Client (Browser/Mobile/Tab)  -- REQUEST ----> Server
</br>

Eg: Show me black jackets on Flipkart
</br>

Client (Browser/Mobile/Tab)  <-- RESPONSE <---- Server
</br>

Eg: Here are the results of your search
</br>


Client (Browser/Mobile/Tab)  <-- RESPONSE via API <---- Server
</br>

Eg: Here are the results of your search
</br>



 ### 🚀 Practical Example:
Client -Server Architecture

Dine in a Restaurant ?

"I want a Cheese Margharita Pizza"

Client: Making Request: Me

Server: Give Response: Kitchen
- Logic: Add Cheese + margharita to the topping
- DB: Ingredients + Crust + ....
</br>


API: Get Results from Server and Give it to Client: Waiter 

UI: Size of Pizza, Looks, ...
</br>

UX: Taste of Pizza, How Crusty it is....
</br>


### 🚀  Web Applications:

Front End:
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JS, Typescript
- Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue

BackEnd:
- Languages: Java, Node.js, Python, C++, C# etc
- Framework: Django, Spring Boot etc

Mobile Application:
- Android (Google): Java, Kotlin 
- iOS (Apple): Swift

</br>

New things: Flutter, React Native : BOTH for Android and iOS

</br>

-> Instagram Clone:
- Front End: React js 
- Back End: Firebase

A: "Hi" -> B

A --> Server ---> B


- A send "Hi" to Server
- Server responds with Ack
- Server will send to B
- B will receive and ack (BLUE TICK/Seen) 
- Server will notify A



Not persisted: Snapchat

(4) Authentication: 
- Sign Up (Create New Username and PW)
- Login (Match Username with PW)


Client ---> Username + PW ----> jkhghdjsg27863787897912 --> Server

	username: devang@gmail.com
	PW: devang
}

devang ---> jkhghdjsg27863787897912: ENCRYPTION


If Correct, Login
Else, Incorrect Password


### 🚀 BackEnd: FIREBASE:

- Firebase: Set of Tools/Suite of Tools
- Firebase: Database
- Firebase: Authentication
- Firebase: Storage
- Firebase: Hosting
- Firebase: Messaging
- Firebase: Realtime Database

### 🚀 FIREBASE Setup STEPS:

Link: https://firebase.google.com/
- Add Project
- Configure Google Analytics
- Register the App with Hosting
- npm install firebase
- sudo npm install -g firebase-tools

Link: https://console.firebase.google.com/


### 🚀  Steps:

(1) Clone the Repo <br /> 
(2) Install Dependencies <br />
Command: `npm install`  <br />
(3) Run the App <br />
Command: `npm start` <br />

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
